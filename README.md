# CSC675-775 Section 03 Database Systems
Welcome to Database Systems!. Please modify this README file with the following info: 

1. Name: UTSAV BHATTA, and student id: 917597933. Otherwise, I don't know who you are and I cannot grade your work

2. Update this table of assignments. Set to done after one of the assignments is completed:


| Assignment               |   Completed/Not-Completed  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Milestone #1             |         completed       |
| Milestone #2             |         completed       |
| Extra-credit             |         completed       |
| Course Project           |         completed       |


If one of the milestones, course project or extra-credit assignment is not set to "completed" by its due date, 
it won't be graded. The first thing I do before grading an assignment is to check the above table.

***Please read carefully all the guidelines described in this README file. 
Failure to follow them, may affect negatively your grade.***

# General Milestones Guidelines:

* In this class students will implement two mandatory milestones; The Conceptual and Relational Models.

* Milestones will help you to understand concepts related to database systems that are needed in the implementation 
of your course project in this class.  

* Read carefully both README files related to homework and course project 

* All the assignments are done individually. However, group work is encouraged to help other students. In addition, 
the instructor will help if a students are stuck in a problem or if students have questions.

* If you miss a milestone, you'll get a 0 in that one. (no exceptions here)

* Milestones are graded based on their completeness and correctness. 

* Each milestone has its own README file with specific docs and instructions.

* Failure to follow the milestones's guidelines may affect negatively your grade.

# General Project Guidelines. 

* In this class students will implement one big programming project

* Projects are individual work. However, group work is encouraged to help other students.

* Students will be provided with enough time to complete the project assigned in this class. 
Project's deadlines will be informed by the instructor in class, by email, and posted on iLearn. 

* Code committed after project deadlines won't be taken into consideration for grading purposes. (no exceptions here)

* Students must provide complete documentation for the course project (README file, and code commented) 

* Failure to provide docs will result in a 30% deduction from your grade in the project.

* If your project does not run or run with errors, you'll get a 0 in that project. (no exceptions here). 
So, test your code properly before committing it to the master branch of your class repository

***Students must commit their work to their class repository. I will grade only work committed (not uploaded)
not the master branch of your class repository. Work committed to repositories other than the student class 
repository won't be graded. No exceptions!***

# General Extra-credit Guidelines

* In this class students will implement one extra-credit assignment; External Sorting or Indexing

* Extra-credit project is 5% worth that will be added to your final grade.

* Extra-credit project is all or nothing. No partial credit will be given. 
So, make sure that you understand the required project specifications before starting its implementation
